## Make Change Project

### Overview

In this project, we were to put together a program that would Make Change from a Cash Register at a self-check out kiosk. The customer would input their item price for purchase, which then would prompt them what their total price was for their purchase, they would then input how much money they were going to pay, and then it would prompt them how much change they were going to get back or prompt them thanking them for the exact amount.

### Topics
* Taking User Input
* Casting
* if/else if/else statements
* Booleans
* Declaring variables

### How to Run

1. First: the user (customer) is prompted to enter in their price of the item they are wishing to purchase.
2. Second: the user (customer) sees on the screen the total amount for this item they are wishing to purchase.
3. Third: the user (customer) is prompted to enter in the amount of money (dollars and coins) they are wishing to pay for this item.
4. Fourth: if the user (customer) provides more than what than what the item costs, the output will display how much change they will be getting back in correct dominations ($Dollars: twenty(s), ten(s), five(s), and one(s)) (cents: quarter(s), nickel(s), dime(s), and penny(s)). With then another prompt that tells them their exact change amount in Dollars and Cents.
5. Fifth: if the user (customer) does not provide the exact change amount for the item they are wishing to purchase, it will prompt them with an error message letting them know they have not provided the correct amount.
6. Sixth: if the user(customer) does provide the exact amount of money, it will prompt the user thanking them for the exact amount of money.
